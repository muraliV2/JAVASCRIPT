<script>
    // string slice is used to slice a part of word from the entire word


    let fullname = 'lionel messi'
    let firstname = fullname.slice(0, 6)
    let lastname = fullname.slice(6,12)
    console.log(`${firstname}  "and his full name is " ${fullname}` )
    console.log(lastname)
</script>
</html>

i actually saved this as js because i used script tag inside an html filee
instead of creating more files i have finished in same file itself
